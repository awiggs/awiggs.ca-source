This personal website is the result of many iterations, learning processes, and different technologies being experimented with.

#### Motivation

Creating a personal website is something I have longed to do since I first started programming in my first year of University.
I was forewarned that web development can be a pain and that the quirks of JavaScript would drive me insane, but that never stopped me.
After creating four or five absolutely awful little websites with vanilla HTML and CSS (occasionally with a splash of JS stolen
from StackOverflow, perhaps to introduce paralax scrolling), I gave up.

However, in my fifth year of my Software Engineering undergraduate degree, I was re-motivated by fellow software engineering Eric Buss (ejrbuss.net)
to try it again. After a few months of learning React and a painstakingly slow UI development process, this is what I came up with!
