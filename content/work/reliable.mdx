## Reliable Controls

Reliable is where I spent my first 12 months of co-op during my software engineering undergraduate degree. Here, I learned essential skills
that have formed the base of the rest of my career.

#### Position Held & Responsibilities
##### First Co-op (May - August, 2017)
During my first co-op, I held the position of software developer on the RC-WebView team. Being my first co-op, and first real software experience,
being able to start as a developer was a dream come true. 

For the majority of this co-op term, I developed skills in web development and understanding the Agile process. I participated in daily scrums,
weekly meetings, and many triage sessions. The experience gained during that first co-op term is something I will use every day of my career 
going forward.


##### Second Co-op (May - December, 2018)
After having such a good experience at Reliable the first time around, I decided to sign on for two more co-op terms. Once again I was given the
title of software developer, however this time I was assigned to different teams. 

Initially I was part of the [RC-Reporter](https://www.reliablecontrols.com/products/software/RCR/) team, which focuses on a product 
built for reporting statistics and analytics based on building data. With them I focused primarily on prototypes with Vue.js for their upcoming
front-end redesign.

After some time, I was moved to the [RC-RemoteAccess](https://www.reliablecontrols.com/products/software/RCRA/) 
project to take on the role of the lead web developer. RC-RemoteAccess was a desktop application, however it was chosen to be the first, 
and the guinea pig, product to adopt Vue.js entirely for its implementation. Therefore, I was in charge of the
front-end development in almost its entirety. This gave me the chance to develop more than just hard, technical skills; it gave me the chance to
understand what it means to have significatly more responsibility, how to manage my time efficiently, and how to communicate with co-workers to
ensure the project is developed in the correct manner.

At the time of my departure from Reliable Controls, the RC-RemoteAccess project had been successfully converted into a web application and was being
primed to ship to customers in the beginning of 2019.
