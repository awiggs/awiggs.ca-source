# About me.
<br />

**I am a Software Engineering student attending UVic in Victoria, British Columbia.**

Currently in my fifth year, graduation is right around the corner! Whilst preparing for the journey into the workforce and finishing my degree, 
I de-stress by sitting down with a good book, listening to a fresh album, or losing myself in a video game with friends.
