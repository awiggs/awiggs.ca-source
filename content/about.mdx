# About me.
<br />

**I am a DevOps Engineer at Lendesk, residing in beautiful Vancouver, BC.**

After graduting from the University of Victoria in April 2020 with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, I promptly joined the workforce as a DevOps Engineer
at Lendesk. After the long years of studying, I currently enjoy spending my evenings going for walks, listening to music or watching movies, or having a drink
with friends.
