# About me.
<br />

**I am a Software Engineering student attending UVic in Victoria, British Columbia.**

Currently I am in my sixth year and graduation is right around the corner! While I prepare for the journey into the workforce 
and finish my degree, I de-stress by sitting down with a good book, listening to a fresh album, or losing myself in a video game with friends.
