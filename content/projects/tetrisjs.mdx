## Tetris JS

A simple Tetris clone built for the purpose of exposing myself to the HTML Canvas. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/awiggs/Tetris) 
and play it [here](https://awiggs.github.io/Tetris/).

#### Motivation
Early in the summer of 2019, I found myself playing Nintendo's Tetris99 on the Switch constantly. It was a great way to pass the time and I soon
found myself playing Tetris on my laptop as well. To play on my laptop, I would find a JavaScript-implemented clone hosted by someone
on their GitHub. I did an initial search into how these clones were implemented and discovered that the 
[HTML Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) was a popular choice. Not having any prior experience with this,
 I set out to create my own Tetris clone to play on the go!

#### Technologies Used
##### [HTML5 Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp)
The majority of the code is written with the HTML5 Canvas, which allows for quick renderings of drawings in JavaScript. Rendering the game board and
the pieces for Tetris was easy enough, and the only slight difficulty I had was managing the timing of the game itself. After doing this project,
I would recommend the HTML5 Canvas to anyone looking to whip up some first-time graphics in a web environment.
