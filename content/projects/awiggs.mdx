## Awiggs.ca

After multiple iterations, experimenting with new technologies, and creating many UI mockups, [Awiggs.ca](https://awiggs.ca) is the final result of my
long-desired personal website.

#### Motivation

Creating a personal website is something I have wanted to do since I first started programming in my first year of University.
I was forewarned that web development can be a pain and that the quirks of JavaScript would drive me insane, but that never stopped me.
After creating four or five absolutely awful little websites with vanilla HTML and CSS (occasionally with a splash of JS stolen
from StackOverflow, usually to introduce parallax scrolling or something of the sort), I gave up.

However, after spending 8 months developing a web application at Reliable Controls and feeling more confident in my skills,
I was re-motivated by fellow software engineer and friend [Eric Buss](https://www.ejrbuss.net) to try my hand at it again. 
After a few months of learning React and a painstakingly slow UI development process, this is the result!

#### Technologies Used
##### [React](https://reactjs.org/)
React is a JavaScript library that I had never used prior to this project. I thought about use Vue.js since I have previous experience from a co-op,
however pushing myself to step outside of my comfort zone and learn something new was an important part of this project. Therefore, React forms
the base of this entire website.

##### [Now](https://zeit.co/)
In my experience, working with GitHub Pages to host a website has caused nothing but headaches. When I discovered Now, a website deployment tool by
Zeit, I was ecstatic. It offers an incredibly convenient way to host a website by simply linking your GitHub repository. On every commit, it generates
a new build and hosts on its own domain URLs. However, by simply adding your own domain to their list, it automatically pushes your website to your 
domain with no extra work.

Now truly is an essential tool.

##### [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
Also by Zeit, the creators of Now, is Next.js. This is a simple JavaScript framework for React that abstracts away the build complexities that can
come with Webpack. Additionally, Next.js supports simple static building and extremely simple page routing, making this a wonderful framework for
any developer that's new to React.

##### Miscellaneous
Other tools used in this project are:

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), a powerful CSS library. I've been using Sass in every web development project
since I came across it and have never looked back.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a simple tool that allows for the writing of plain Markdown text that is then compiled into JSX for React components. MDX
allows for the mixed use of React components and Markdown, and will forever be a staple of web development projects for myself.
