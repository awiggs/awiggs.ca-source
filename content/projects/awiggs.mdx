## Awiggs.ca

After multiple iterations, experimenting with new technologies, and creating many UI mockups, [Awiggs.ca](awiggs.ca) is the final result of my
long-desired personal website.

#### Motivation

Creating a personal website is something I have wanted to do since I first started programming in my first year of University.
I was forewarned that web development can be a pain and that the quirks of JavaScript would drive me insane, but that never stopped me.
After creating four or five absolutely awful little websites with vanilla HTML and CSS (occasionally with a splash of JS stolen
from StackOverflow, usually to introduce parallax scrolling or something of the sort), I gave up.

However, after spending 8 months developing a web application at Reliable Controls and feeling more confident in my skills,
I was re-motivated by fellow software engineering [Eric Buss](www.ejrbuss.net) to try my hand at it again. 
After a few months of learning React and a painstakingly slow UI development process, this is the result!
