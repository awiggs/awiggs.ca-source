## Chip-Gr8

[Chip-Gr8](https://chipgr8.io) is a platform aimed at allowing junior developers to create artificial intelligence agents for simple games,
such as Pong, Space Invaders, and Breakout, on the CHIP-8 system.

#### Motivation

In the fifth year of UVic's engineering programs, each student is required to create a capstone project in their designated 499 course.
Chip-Gr8 became the project developed by myself and 5 other colleagues, all of whom can be found on the Chip-Gr8 [website](https://chipgr8.io).

The team wanted to create a project that would both benefit and educate new developers, while also introducing ourselves to common artificial
intelligence technologies.

#### Technologies Used
##### [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
In a nutshell, scikit-learn is a set of tools that can be used for machine learning with Python. Scikit-learn offers a range of simple tools that
are built on top of other popular libraries such as Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. In an artificial intelligence project such as Chip-Gr8, scikit-learn
provided an interface for getting simple agents up and running.

##### [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
Similarly, PyTorch is another common machine learning library available for Python. It also offers a range of tools, and prides itself on being
smooth and seamless. Because it's also built exclusively for Python, it is easily integratable with other Python libraries.

##### [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
TensorFlow is... yup, you guessed it!... another machine learning platform for Python! Perhaps the most commonly used, TensorFlow is an open-source project
that features extremely powerful tools for creating machine learning algorithms. It is a very popular choice for solving both simple and complex ML
problems.

##### [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
NumPy is one of those Python libraries that you just couldn't live without. At this point it's an essential library for scientific and mathematical
calculations and is used in almost every Python program that involves calculations. Within Chip-Gr8, NumPy powers the vast majority of the calculations
and certainly handles all complex maths.

##### [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
This library is another open-source Python library, however pygame's purpose is to provide an interface for developing multimedia applications.
It has become quite common with simple games written in Python, and Chip-Gr8's display is powered by pygame.
