## Chip-Gr8

[Chip-Gr8](https://chipgr8.io) is a platform aimed at allowing junior developers to create artificial intelligence agents for simple games,
such as Pong, Space Invaders, and Breakout, on the CHIP-8 system.

#### Motivation

In the fifth year of UVic's engineering programs, each student is required to create a capstone project in their designated 499 course.
Chip-Gr8 became the project developed by myself and 5 other colleagues, all of whom can be found on the Chip-Gr8 [website](https://chipgr8.io).

The team wanted to create a project that would both benefit and educate new developers, while also introducing ourselves to common artificial
intelligence technologies.
